/**
 * FSServiceActivityView singelton represents the feedback service and its view. It receives and updates information in background threads.
 * It is responsible for both logic and drawing of said element as long as the input conforms to FSData protocol. If not, it silently dismisses the input data.
 * The programmer who integrates this module is responsible for dismissing/removing the view either by passing currentStep = maxSteps, or manually by invoking removeFromView.
